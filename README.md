🔍 Detecting fraudulent transactions using anomaly detection models


 Abstract
 Anomaly detection for financial transactions is used to detect fraud, secure sensi
tive data, and gain higher transaction processing system efficiency. In this paper,
 a broad analysis of different machine learning methods for fraud detection is stud
ied along with their unsupervised learning techniques. This article breaks down
 the application of Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Autoencoders,
 and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to financial datasets for anomaly
 detection. We compare these models against others, for which we calculate AUC,
 Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Precision-Recall scores on our data.
 The outcomes show that the deep learning algorithms in Autoencoder and CNNs
 are far more accurate and resilient than the traditional models for abnormality
 detection. The results are critical for developing more advanced, effective, and
 efficient fraud detection systems in the financial domain.
